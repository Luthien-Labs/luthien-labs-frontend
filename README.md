# Luthien Labs

## What is this

This is the front end for the Luthien Labs website. It uses Deno and Astro. It also includes a Nix flake to set up the dev environment.

The content is satirical and not meant to be taken for any more than that.

## How is this

To run the dev environment from scratch, navigate to the folder and run

`nix develop`

Then run

`deno install`

and finally

`deno run dev`
